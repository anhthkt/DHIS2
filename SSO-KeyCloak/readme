The basic flow of authentication and authorization between DHIS2 and Keycloak can be summarized as follows:

1. A user attempts to access a DHIS2 application or resource that requires authentication.

2. The DHIS2 application redirects the user to the Keycloak server for authentication.

3. The user logs in to the Keycloak server using their username and password.

4. If the user's credentials are valid, Keycloak generates an access token and returns it to the DHIS2 application.

5. The DHIS2 application uses the access token to authorize the user's access to the requested resource.

6. If the user is authorized to access the resource, the DHIS2 application allows the user to proceed with their request.

7. If the user is not authorized to access the resource, the DHIS2 application returns an appropriate error message.

8. The user may continue to access resources within the DHIS2 application until their access token expires or is revoked by Keycloak.

9. When the user logs out of the DHIS2 application, the DHIS2 application notifies the Keycloak server to invalidate the user's access token.
